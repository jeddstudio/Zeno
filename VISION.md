# Zeno: The AI-First Markdown Editor

> "Zeno bridged the gap between the instant and the infinite; we bridge the gap between human thought and AI agency."

## Vision
Zeno is not just another Markdown editor. It is a **Next-Generation Knowledge Environment** designed for a world where AI agents (like Claude Code, Antigravity, and OpenCode) are active collaborators in your knowledge vault.

## Core Pillars
1. **Speed (Powered by Zed)**: Built on Zed's GPUI framework, Zeno offers GPU-accelerated rendering and a zero-latency editing experience, even in vaults with tens of thousands of files.
2. **AI Sovereignty (Integrated Terminal)**: The terminal is the heart of Zeno. It provides a first-class interface for CLI AI agents to interact with your local files safely and efficiently.
3. **Seamless Hybrid Rendering**: Inspired by Zettlr and Obsidian, Zeno provides a beautiful "WYSIWYG-ish" experience while keeping the underlying Markdown pure and accessible.
4. **Local-First & Open Source**: Your data belongs to you. Zeno is open-source (GPL-v3) and operates entirely on your local file system.

## Credits
Zeno is made possible by the incredible work of:
- **Zed Industries**: For GPUI (UI framework).
- **The Zettlr Team**: For inspiration in smart academic writing and Markdown workflows.
