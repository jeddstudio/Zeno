# Research Notes

This folder is the public (tracked) location for engineering/research notes that inform Zeno’s design.

Guidelines:
- Prefer short, high-signal notes with links to source material.
- Keep “ref-only” explorations here as *ideas/observations*, not as code dependencies.
- Do not require any files under `local/` for builds or runtime behavior.
